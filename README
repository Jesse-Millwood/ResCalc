This program is a Resistor Divider Calculator that does the calculation
based on physically available resistor values. The gui is written in python 
and uses the wxWidgets module. 

To use:
  * Put all files in the same directory and run ResCalc_wx.py from the command line.
  * Select the resistors to use in the calculation
  * Click on the input box for Input Voltage and type the input voltage AND PRESS ENTER while the box is still selected
  * Click on the input box for Output Voltage and type the output voltage AND PRESS ENTER while the box is still selected
  * You must press enter after typing in the desired voltages
  * The results will appear in the text box on the right side of the gui
